        <h2>Her best soul traits</h2>
        <p>She always rejoices every day, and infects everyone around her, and me in particular, with a couple she is sad and angry when she doesnâ€™t get something but quickly leaves, at such moments the most necessary thing is to let her think everything over and then hug and kiss.
             It is also important to say that she has the kindest soul in the whole world, people like her are very difficult to find and I was lucky she became my girlfriend. 
            After all, I am an okuton with kindness and I myself have become kinder. She is also very diligent and goes to the end and inspires me to many things.
             And this is a small part of her qualities, more will be said further.</p>
